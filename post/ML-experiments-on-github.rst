Machine Learning Experiments Project on GitHub
==============================================

I started a new project on GitHub. It's called
`ml-experiments <https://github.com/PhilipMay/ml-experiments>`__. Here I
plan to host some Jupyter Notebooks with different machine learning
experiments. Since today I did some experiments with `Batch
Normalization Batch Normalization and different initializers
with Keras.

For visualisation, t-test and to call the different experiments with
different parameters I use my other GitHub project called 
`MLTB (Machine Learning Toolbox) <https://github.com/PhilipMay/mltb>`__.
