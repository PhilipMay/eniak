2019-01-01 Happy New Year 2019!
===============================

Since it is a new year since today I would like to recommend this video
from Alexander Gerst. He is a German ESA astronaut and geophysicist. His
words are very inspiring and touching.

It is a message to his grandchildren and might be what you are looking
for as an inspiration for this new year. The language is German but with
English subtitle.

I wish you a happy new year with happiness, health and success.
