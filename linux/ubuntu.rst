Ubuntu
======

Package Management
------------------

Update the System

   apt update       # Fetches the list of available updates
   apt list --upgradable # see list of packages that can be upgraded
   apt upgrade      # Installs some updates; does not remove packages
   apt full-upgrade # Installs updates; may also remove some packages, if needed
   apt autoremove   # Removes any old packages that are no longer needed

Get Info about a .deb File

``dpkg -I <package_name>.deb``

List Content of a .deb File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``dpkg -c <package_name>.deb``

Install Ubuntu as a VirtualBox Guest
------------------------------------

This describes how to install Ubuntu as a VirtualBox guest system to do
experiments with docker or other stuff.

Basic installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  download a server version of Ubuntu
-  the current LTS version might be a good idea
-  do normal installation

Install XFCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To be able to copy and paste to and from the guest system you need a
desktop environment like XFCE. XFCE is small compared to GNOME and the
minimal installation does not contain LibreOffice and other stuff you do
not need. - install ``tasksel``: ``sudo apt install tasksel`` - execute
``tasksel``: ``sudo tasksel`` - select ``Xubuntu minimal installation``
- press tabulatur and select ``Ok`` with return key - reboot

Install VirtualBox Guest Additions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  install ``build-essential`` with:
   ``sudo apt-get install build-essential``
-  link the VirtualBox Guest Additions iso image to a cd drive
-  cd should be auto mounted to somewhere at ``/media`` if XFCE or GNOME
   is installed
-  change to that directory and execute installation:
   ``sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run``

Install Docker
--------------

To install docker do not install the package called ``docker``. Docker
is a " System tray for KDE3/GNOME2 docklet applications". The package
you need is called ``docker.io`` - install with:
``sudo apt install docker.io`` - start with:
``sudo systemctl start docker`` - stop with:
``sudo systemctl stop docker`` - enable (always start at boot time)
with: ``sudo systemctl enable docker``
