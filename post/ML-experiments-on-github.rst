Machine Learning Experiments Project on GitHub
==============================================

I started a new project on GitHub. It is called
`ml-experiments <https://github.com/PhilipMay/ml-experiments>`__. Here I
plan to host some Jupyter Notebooks with different machine learning
experiments. Since today I did some experiments with Batch Normalization
and different initializers with Keras.

For visualisation, t-test and to call the different experiments with
different parameters I use my other GitHub project called `MLTB (Machine
Learning Toolbox) <https://github.com/PhilipMay/mltb>`__.
